Alright I thought that we could use this to kindof help keep everyone in the loop of things. If you have any comments that you want 
 others to know just go ahead and post it in here.
 
Also I think the best way to push code into master is to create your own branch upload your code then do a pull request to your branch
linking it to the master branch.
 
 
 Austin: So for the project I am right now looking into Tkinter as the GUI portion of our code if anyone has any better ideas or 
          something already in the works let me know otherwise I'm gonna keep going tdown this path.
